# Response Code Chain Checker

The `rcode` CLI lets you see the raw response code and, if applicable, the
redirect chain of a URL.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working Go environment and `GOPATH/bin` is in your
`PATH`, install `rcode` with

```shell
go get github.com/mxlje/rcode
```

Alternatively you can grab the latest compiled version from the
[releases section on GitHub][releases] and put it in your `PATH` by hand.
