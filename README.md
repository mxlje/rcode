# Response Code Chain Checker

This is the first (and pretty rough) version of a command line utility
to quickly display the response code and, if applicable, redirect chain
of a URL. It can be really helpful for debugging or just sensible web
development in general.

Again, itâ€™s in its early stages and will receive a lot more love in the
coming days.
